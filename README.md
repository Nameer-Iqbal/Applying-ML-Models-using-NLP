# Applying-ML-Models-using-NLP  
The task is to collect and preprocess a dataset for NLP and apply relevant machine learning models for analysis. This includes steps such as text preprocessing, vector representation, and topic modeling.
- Data Scraping: Fetches and processes text from a Wikipedia page.
- Text Preprocessing: Tokenizes text and removes stopwords.
- Word2Vec: Word2Vec is used to represent words as vectors (array). These vectors capture the meaning of words by placing similar words close to eachother in the vector space.
- LDA: LDA model is used to find hidden topics within a collection of documents. Each document is viewed as a mixture of topic and each topic is a mixture of words.

Dataset: The dataset usedfor this problem is a wikipedia webpage. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi
